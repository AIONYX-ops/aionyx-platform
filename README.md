# AIONYX: Artificial Intelligence for Resilient Ops

**AIONYX** (AI + Onyx) represents a fusion of **Artificial Intelligence** and the **Onyx** stone—a symbol of strength, stability, and reliability. This project is an AI-driven AIOps platform designed to predict failures, detect anomalies, and optimize costs in Kubernetes-based systems.

## 🚀 Vision
To build a production-grade MLOps platform that bridges the gap between infrastructure engineering (DevOps) and data-driven intelligence (Data Science).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Orchestration**: Dagster
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB potentially)
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Terraform
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Language**: Python
- **ML**: Scikit-learn, PyTorch (Anomaly Detection, Time-series Forecasting)

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `platform/`: Core application logic (Dagster, ML pipelines, API).
- `infra/`: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, K8s manifests).
- `docs/`: Thesis documentation, system architecture, and business roadmap.
- `experiments/`: Jupyter notebooks and datasets for research.

## 📖 Thesis Context
This repository serves as the primary codebase for the Master's Thesis: *"An Intelligent AIOps Platform for Predictive Reliability and Cost Optimization in Kubernetes"*.

Developed as a Master's Thesis at Malmö University.
