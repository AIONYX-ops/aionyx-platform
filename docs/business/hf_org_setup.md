### Why this design?
- **Onyx Colors**: Deep blacks and greys represent stability and the "Onyx" part of the name.
- **Vibrant Accents**: Cyan/Blue represents the "Intelligence" and "Cloud" (Kubernetes) nature of the project.
- **Minimalism**: High-end startups use clean, recognizable symbols that look good on a dashboard or a dark-mode IDE.
